# Team Contract


## Daily Routine

We will have a <b>daily meeting at 15:00 UTC (11:00 EST | 17:00 CET)</b>. I will be available in the Main Office channel for at least 30 minutes. Structure of the meeting will be going around to tell:
1. `What you did yesterday?`
2. `What you will do today?`
3. `Are you stuck on anything?`

Different team members have different availabilities so I understand there can be days where people don't have any time, if you aren't able to attend the meeting, post your update in the #general channel in Discord

## Working Routine

We have about 20 days to finish the project, I've broken this up in the 5 4 day sections with milestones in each:

| Milestone Date      | Description | Our Progress |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----- |
| `before June 6th`      | Agree on and document an idea for our main game loop  | Complete |
| `before June 10th`      | Prototype and Agree on an Art Style / Design -> Game Design Doc is finalized  | Complete |
| `before June 14th`      | Expand Prototype in all ways, Environment, Materials, UI / UX, Cinematics, Adding more core interactions / features  | In Progress |
| `before June 18th`      | Start Testing more aggressively, Decide on a few additional small features to add | Not Started |
| `before June 22th`      | Testing / Packaging / Cinematics / Bug Fixing Only | Not Started |


## Workflow

### Normal Git flow
1. Decide what specific task you are about to work on
2. Post in the `#code` channel about what you are about to work on so others know that area is being changed
3. Do the work
4. Add a clear commit message
5. Push your changes when you are done

**Notes:** 
1. If you are comfortable with git [branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell), please use them as it will make working together a lot easier, if you're not I'll post something here about them and if you want me to walk you through using them, I'm happy to do it. (or check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cLlX0ZqO5Q) for a guide)
2. Try not to do too much work at a time while making sure the `main` branch is always working (not breaking)
    - Scope out small tasks to start with that you can hopefully finish in a single working session
    - If you've been working on something for more than 3 days, bring it up and we'll find a way to integrate it in before the repository gets too different
